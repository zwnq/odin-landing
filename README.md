# Landing Page Project for The Odin Project Foundations Course
<p>This project follows the fundamentals taught in the first sections of TOP Foundations Course focusing on HTML and CSS, most notably using Flexbox</p>
<p>The project is divided into six sections:<p>
<ol>
  <li>Header</li>
  <li>Eyecatcher</li>
  <li>Random Information</li>
  <li>Quote from Sun Tzu</li>
  <li>Call to Action</li>
  <li>Footer</li>
</ol>

> Note: The project does not have any working functionalities as it focuses on designing a webpage using Flexbox based from the given design; I only added some customization following the design. This may however be edited in the future for personal usage.
